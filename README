Note: full control since August (partially also July) 2014

Note: reference should be month beginning/end. All purchases within the month should be accounted for in the month!
This means, if e.g. you bought it on 31th but it was withdrawn on 3rd next month, the balance in the beginning of the month
should have the purchase subtracted (i.e. it won't be equal to what is shown on bank status page in the sparda system)
---> note withdrawn mechanism cures this problem - if not withdrawn yet, just mark it as not withdrawn!!! then the balance will be the same!

Note:
clean control since 1.1.2017. Before that sometimes periods with many untracked expenses (esp. cash withdrawals)
