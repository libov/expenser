* how to make tabs? -> one tab for stat analysis, other for table display. maybe one more for editing...
* how to make graphs (for stat analysis)

* by adding more entries, the table doesn't fit to the program window anymore... -> fixed by setting max 30 entries to the table and not redrawing the window/table.. 
   need to find a way to redraw the table, then everything should be ok.
* hints/description of the fields (frame around?)
* edit entries from XML file, in particular withdrawn or not
* automatic sorting according to date?
* display total number of entries
* test if statistics calculation works ok
