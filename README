Goals:

1. Check that income claimed by the bank corresponds to the one claimed by DESY
2. Check that all expenses claimed by the bank can be traced back
3. Check the calculation of the bank
4. Analyse expenses. Dominant ones that could be spared on? Any trends?

Todo:

* introduce sub-categories? (like car: diesel, parts, fines, regular payments such as HUK/Steuer)
* think about categories. e.g. category unknown into two: know what but no receipt, and don't know at all
* implement some filtering into expenses table, or create another tab for that
* bar chart histograms - MAJOR
* average, line and a number - MAJOR
* 'withdrawn' with a single click - not entering the ID - MAJOR
* balance. income. balance tab. - MAJOR
* test if statistics calculation works ok - MAJOR
* edit entries from XML file, in particular withdrawn or not - MAJOR
* red color of the cells if not withdrawn!!!

* improve overall layout - MINOR
* hints/description of the fields (frame around?) - MINOR

Note:
"clean" control since 1.1.2017. Before that sometimes periods with many untracked expenses (esp. cash withdrawals)
otherwise 2016, 2015 and partially 2014 are in the database
