This changelog was created on 12.3.2017

* 12.3.2017 Introduced another category, "No record". These are expenses which I can't
            track back to receipts or other records. Should be different from "category unkown" when
            I have a record but don't know what the money was spent for. Before 12.3.17 was not
            separating between the two. Ultimately should edit earlier expenses.

* 20.3.2017 Not redrawing the UI upon adding new expenes - found a way to update the table (delete / create new interface, then call the Update method for the table)
            Introduced filtering the expenses. Made cosmetic changes to the expenses tab.

* 8.7.2017 Added total monthly sum calculation
